    abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) with electronic health records (EHR) is growing in popularity as a means to extract knowledge that can improve the decision-making process in healthcare. Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data. Studies also explore improvements to the aggregation mechanisms required to generate the learning model from distributed contributions and case studies with different types of medical data.},

    abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin, can prove to be essential towards realizing the vision of a decentralized, secure, and open Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. There is a growing interest in many research groups towards leveraging blockchains to provide IoT data privacy without the need for a centralized data access model. This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms. The architecture is aimed to have privacy built into it, and to be adaptable for various IoT use cases. To understand the feasibility and deployment considerations for implementing the proposed architecture, we conduct performance analysis of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum and Monax.},

    abstract = {``Notice and choice'' is the predominant approach for data privacy protection today. There is considerable user-centered research on providing effective privacy notices but not enough guidance on designing privacy choices. Recent data privacy regulations worldwide established new requirements for privacy choices, but system practitioners struggle to implement legally compliant privacy choices that also provide users meaningful privacy control. We construct a design space for privacy choices based on a user-centered analysis of how people exercise privacy choices in real-world systems. This work contributes a conceptual framework that considers privacy choice as a user-centered process as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to design meaningful privacy choices in their systems. We also present a use case of how we leverage the design space to finalize the design decisions for a real-world privacy choice platform, the Internet of Things (IoT) Assistant, to provide meaningful privacy control in the IoT.},
