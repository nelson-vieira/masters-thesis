    abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin, can prove to be essential towards realizing the vision of a decentralized, secure, and open Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. There is a growing interest in many research groups towards leveraging blockchains to provide IoT data privacy without the need for a centralized data access model. This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms. The architecture is aimed to have privacy built into it, and to be adaptable for various IoT use cases. To understand the feasibility and deployment considerations for implementing the proposed architecture, we conduct performance analysis of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum and Monax.},

    abstract = {Anonymous exchange of data has a strong demand in many scenarios. With the development of IoT and wireless networks, plenty of smart devices are interconnected through wireless technologies such as 5G and Wi-Fi, making it possible to use them for information exchanging. The authors find a P2P network model for secure and anonymous communication, which is a typical Crowds system and the operating mechanism meets the characteristics of limited-resources of IoT devices. Based on this network model, the authors design a lightweight communication scheme for the remote-control system in this work, using two kinds of Virtual-Spaces to achieve the purpose of identity announced and data exchanged. The authors implemented a prototype system of the scheme and tested it over the Freenet, proving that the scheme can effectively resist the impact of flow analysis on the anonymity of communication while ensuring communication data security. By analyzing the scheme's performance, the author believes that the scheme is practical and is suitable for scenarios that are not time-sensitive but require high anonymity.},

    abstract = {``Notice and choice'' is the predominant approach for data privacy protection today. There is considerable user-centered research on providing effective privacy notices but not enough guidance on designing privacy choices. Recent data privacy regulations worldwide established new requirements for privacy choices, but system practitioners struggle to implement legally compliant privacy choices that also provide users meaningful privacy control. We construct a design space for privacy choices based on a user-centered analysis of how people exercise privacy choices in real-world systems. This work contributes a conceptual framework that considers privacy choice as a user-centered process as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to design meaningful privacy choices in their systems. We also present a use case of how we leverage the design space to finalize the design decisions for a real-world privacy choice platform, the Internet of Things (IoT) Assistant, to provide meaningful privacy control in the IoT.},
