\par
This chapter presents the results of the questionnaire about participants'
perceptions of privacy, IoT and theirs online behaviors, as well as the usability
tests that were conducted for the mobile application.

\subsection{Stage 1: Survey}

As would be expected, the majority of participants agreed that data privacy
is important to them and as such should be protected, as can be inferred
in Figure \ref{fig:privacy_is_important_to_me}. Most participants
also have some knowledge of behaviours or techniques to do
in an online environment, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:techniques_to_guarantee_privacy}, be it connected to the internet or on some
local network, like not sharing too much private information
(or none at all) with strangers, revealing only the bare minimum necessary
information to use a particular system, use of VPNs, different and strong
passwords, 2 step authentication methods between others. Because a good
portion of participants are from engineering areas this question might be
skewed.

Most participants consider data privacy as a human and consumer right,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:privacy_human_right_histogram}, even if they have
no knowledge of article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

When asked to define digital privacy, most participants did not know
how to properly define it, giving generic answers while some even gave a one word answer,
some participants gave incomplete or adjacent related answers. Only approximately
16\% of participants supplied a concrete answer that was close to the definition
presented in Chapter \ref{introduction}. Curiously, no one mentioned security,
which contradicts with the responses represented in Figure \ref{fig:security_equals_privacy},
where 53.33\% of participants believe that privacy and security are synonymous.

Participants have some digital literacy of IT terms, as shown on
Figure \ref{fig:familiar_terms}, most know the more popular
terms like \textit{wi-fi}, \textit{cookie} and \textit{data protection},
but as the terms become more esoteric the general knowledge starts
to drop. Some terms, even after getting some popularity,
are still mostly unknown to the majority of people like \textit{blockchain} or \textit{Internet of Things}.

Regarding users' online habits, all participants have, or have access to, a smartphone
and they use it in their daily lives, most participants concede that they spend a lot
of their daily time using it, like shown in Figure \ref{fig:phone_access}, and are
somewhat worried but do not actively try to protect their data privacy, which
goes against their earlier responses regarding their worry of personal data privacy.
When asked if they accept
cookies, respondents occasionally do but are unsure what they do or their
importance on the user experience.

When asked about the concept of profiling, only half of the participants
are aware of the term but more than half consider that their online
activity contributes to its development, see Figure \ref{fig:activity_contributes_profiling}.

Regarding participants relation with regulations, most participants are
aware of regulations related to digital privacy, like GDPR or CCPA, but
it's not absolutely clear to them what they represent and they do not
show a clear interest in know more about these regulations, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:privacy_regulations}. It is not
clear why there is a certain disinterest by most participants in regulations,
it might be that most find it frustrating to read, or there is some
faith that they work and as such there is no need to know more about them.
Notably 0,47\% of the participants responded correctly to the question
about GDPR's definition of personal data.

Most participants, 73.33\%, do not know what a data protection officer is
or what are their duties, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:aware_dpo}.
An internal role known as a data protection officer acts as an independent
spokesman for a company's policies regarding the processing and
application of customer data. The GDPR, which requires the appointment
of a data protection officer by all businesses that offer goods or
services to consumers in the European Union and collect data as a
result, led to the creation of this job. The data protection officer
keeps up with data protection regulations and policies, conducts
internal privacy audits, and ensures that all other compliance-related
data-related concerns are current.

As expressed before, participants consider the protection of private data important
and as such 82.22\% are interested in knowing where and how their data is used by
organizations, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:interested_where_how_information_used}.

Questions related to privacy notices are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:privacy_notices}.
Participants are interested in knowing how their data is used by organizations,
and privacy notices are one way to convey such information, but not all privacy
notices are created equal, specially in the IoT, yet 53.33\% are not familiar with
the reason data is collected but are still curious. Most participants agree that
lengthy texts and font size, 86.67\% and 77.78\% respectively, affect their
willingness to read them, 71.11\% confess to agreeing to the notices just to use
the service due to a fear of missing out. In regards to brand trust, participants
are divided with 33.33\% agreeing to not reading the privacy notice if they trust
the organization and 33.33\% disagreeing.

Figure \ref{fig:concerns} depicts questions related to participants
privacy related concerns. Participants answered almost unanimously to
all questions with most answers being 7, the questions that deviate
from the rule concern public institutions or intelligence services analysing
participants' online movements and organizations collecting and using
participants' online activity respectively where most responded between
a 5 and 6 meaning that some participants are not as concerned when
public institutions or organizations collect their online activities.
Participants show more concern when organizations collect data without
their consent or when others engage in identity theft.

The majority of participants admitted to inputting varying amounts of
incorrect information, with only 15.56\% of participants claiming to never
have entered fake information when setting up an account on a platform,
and 6.67\% said they always do, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:creating_account_false_data}.
The most typical inaccurate information
entered by participants concerns their age, phone number, complete name,
birthday, electronic mail, username, home address and country of citizenship.
The most common reasons participants give for entering this false
information are when creating a temporary account or they
find that the information is not relevant, some stated that they do
not want to provide any information that may be used to identify them.

Most participants are unaware of how digital data flows, as 82.22\% state
being unfamiliar with data brokers, according to Figure \ref{fig:aware_data_brokers}.
But they are aware that organisations collect their private data and use it
in various ways, even without knowing exactly what they do with the data
according to previous responses. If more individuals were aware of the function
of a data broker, which plays an important role on data flow and can be an individual
or a company which specializes in collecting and selling private data, their decisions
undoubtedly be affected by this knowledge.

In terms of IoT usage and literacy, about 2/3 of the participants have interacted in
some way with a device, and from those who have used an IoT device, only close
to a third (35.56\%) actually have a device in their homes, as depicted on
Figure \ref{fig:internet_of_things_device_usage}. Even though most participants
have interacted with an IoT device they had trouble actually explaining what Internet
of Things actually is. When asked to describe it, 48\% of the participants
wrote some kind of ``do not know'' variation, from the other 52\% that gave
a more elaborate answer 70\% gave a generic answer that could be applied to
a number of things, some described it like objects that are connected
to the internet. Only two participants managed to describe IoT accurately.
Most participants know devices that can be characterized as belonging to
the Internet of Things like smart homes devices, including smart
appliances like fridges, smart locks or virtual assistants that
function with natural language commands, so even though the majority
of respondents do not know how to define they can recognize IoT devices.

Familiarity with IoT devices does not imply understanding of IoT systems
or the majority of IoT related concepts or terms,
as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:familiar_terms_iot},
the most recognized terms are the ones who have more visibility
in everyday life like smart home, smart vehicle or fully autonomous car.
Esoteric terms like the ones describing networks or protocols are mostly
unknown to most respondents, only to those that have certain
qualifications or who work in IT or similar areas have knowledge of these concepts.

\subsection{Stage 2: Application}

The usability test was given to each participant before giving a basic debrief
of what the application is about. Participants would score the overall difficulty
after performing each task. When participants first used the application they
found it to be similar to other mapping applications, they had some difficulty
adjusting to the application's function but were quick to adapt. The tasks consisted
of navigating the application and performing certain actions such as creating
a user account or adding an IoT device, these tasks include navigating to the IoT devices
page; looking up information about any one particular device; navigating to the
homepage and performing the same action as the previous step; looking up
general information about the application itself; creating an account;
looking up information about privacy, the Internet of Things, and how
to add a device to the application; adding an IoT device; and finally,
updating an IoT device. The first tests revealed to be
somewhat difficult because of a language barrier, the application, at the
time, was only available in english and the participants had a rough grasp of it.
It was still possible to conduct the tests after translating everything the application
did.
Some participants struggled to
find the IoT devices on the application at the start, but eventually it
became second nature. There was also some difficulty in adding an IoT device,
mostly from older participants. Participants who were already comfortable with
technology or who had worked in fields connected to IT did not have any trouble
completing each task, although only one of these participants had some knowledge
of IoT.

Figure \ref{fig:single_ease_questions} shows the average responses of the
single ease questions. Participants found task 8, on average, to be the most difficult,
in which they were asked to add an IoT device to the application. The
participants that had the most difficulty also had very little knowledge
about IoT, which made the task more difficult; they were unsure what type
of information to insert, despite the fact that hints are provided in the
form and the user is warned if any information entered is erroneous. In
general the lack awareness about IoT correlates with the challenge faced when
performing some tasks. The older age group of participants struggled more on the
tests while the younger participants demonstrated no noticeable difficulties.

The system usability scale was used after the participants
performed all tasks, using this system an average score of 90,95 was achieved.
In Figure \ref{fig:system_usability_scale_scores} the scores of
each participant can be seen.
The score was calculated by using the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{sus}
    Score = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(P_i)}{n}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of participants, which in this case is equal to 7,
and $f(P)$, representing each participants' response ($P$), is noted as:
\begin{equation}\label{individual_sus}
    ((Q1-1)+(7-Q2)+(Q3-1)+(7-Q4)+(Q5-1)+(7-Q6)+(Q7-1)+(7-Q8)+(Q9-1)+(7-Q10))*\frac{5}{3}
\end{equation}
where $Q1$, $Q2$, $Q3$, $Q4$, $Q5$, $Q6$, $Q7$, $Q8$, $Q9$ and $Q10$ refers to
the score of a participant for each question.

\nameref{appendix:sus} shows the scoring in more detail.
The obtained value of 90,95 is a high score which would mean that the application provides
a good user experience, even though some users experienced some
hardships when using it when the first tests where being performed.
The feedback given by these participants helped in improving the application,
as is the example of when the application when only available in english,
now it is possible to use it in english and in portuguese, in the future
more language might be added.

An improvement to the usability tests would be to have the participation of
an expert software developer, preferably with experience in IoT systems.
