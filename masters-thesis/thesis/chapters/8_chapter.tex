\section{Future work}

Although there are existing hardware solutions that can detect some devices
on particular networks, like ZigBee or Bluetooth LE, namely IoT sniffers
and there exist some georeferencing applications that try to pinpoint certain
IoT devices, there is still a need for some kind of device or framework
that is network agnostic and can detect where the devices are located and
what kind of data the IoT devices that are around it are collecting. This
gadget should also be capable of informing users about the privacy notices
of the devices and what can the users do to safeguard their personal data.
The IoT sniffers that are available are primarily used in the detection
of problems in the communication of devices in the network or to solve problems
of interoperability between different IoT networks. There are many obstacles
that impede the creation of such a device and the fact that it still does
not exist anything like it may be related ton either there iss not enough
interest from users or researchers to focus on such an endeavour or the
complexity of such a task is greater than the rewards.
