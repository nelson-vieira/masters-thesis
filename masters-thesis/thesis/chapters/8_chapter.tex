\section{Conclusion}

This project aims to do an exploratory analysis of privacy in IoT systems.
It proposes a survey to better understand user's knowledge on this subject
and an application that aims to create more users awareness and better inform
about their environment, as well as the IoT devices that inhabit it and
how they can respond accordingly.

Hopefully the work conducted on this project will be useful to further support
researchers and the application that will be developed will be able to
provide greater visibility, thus allowing users to acquire knowledge about
the data being collected and how they can adjust their behavior or respond
more effectively to protect their privacy rights.
