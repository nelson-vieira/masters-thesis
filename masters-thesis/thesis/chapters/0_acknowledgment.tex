\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Mary Barreto, for
all the support given, since the initial idea for this dissertation until its conclusion,
the feedback I received was invaluable during the whole process.

I want to thank Prof. Am√¢ndio Azevedo for his invaluable insights in the beginning phase of
this work.

I want to give a special thank you to all the people who volunteered to
participate in both the questionnaire and the usability tests, without them this work
would not be possible. Their perspective on privacy and the Internet of Things helped
tremendously during the course of this project, specifically on the development of the application.

Last but not least, I want to thank all the people who supported me during this
process, to my friends that helped to alleviate the difficulties faced and
to my family who always supported me, in particular a special thank you my mother
who always gave me motivation to continue forward.
