\section{Discussion}\label{section:discussion}

\par
This chapter serves to discusses the main takeaways found in the literature
review and address the results of the questionnaire and the usability tests,
and any other interesting remarks found during the course of this work. The
research questions that were posed in Chapter \ref{introduction} will also
be addressed.

\subsection{SLR Findings}

There has been a rising interest by research papers in addressing privacy
issues or challenges in the Internet of Things, at least since 2015-2016
where the number or papers jumped from 11 600 in 2015 to 19 400 in 2016
and rising since then until reaching a peak of 74 400 in 2020 and slightly
declining since then, and at least until August of 2023 there have been
around 36 000 papers published, according to the data seen in Figure \ref{fig:iotprivacy_papers}.

Figure \ref{fig:privacy_keywords_papers} depicts the number of publications
per topic in multiple databases, all of which are still related to the main
theme of privacy in the IoT, particularly Google Scholar, BASE, and CORE. This
data is from papers since 2020, the database with the most papers is Google Scholar
followed by the distant second BASE and finally
CORE with the smallest number of papers. Around 249000 papers exist discussing privacy
in the IoT in Google Scholar, 20641 papers on CORE and 8014 on BASE, from these papers
the most researched topic has been security with around 196000 papers on Google Scholar,
17738 on CORE and 5600 on BASE. This data cannot be accepted at face value because
searches on these databases are conducted using keywords, these keywords may occur
in the title of the work or on the content, but this does not imply that the work
is about keywords in general, rather, it simply indicates that the keywords appear
on the work. But it can represent a rough estimate of what is being researched.
Other databases were used in course of the research like Semantic Scholar,
Baidu Scholar and RefSeek but these databases do not have good
filters for advanced searching and/or have a small number of papers.

There is a big focus on security, AI and blockchain in recent literature,
specially from 2020 onward. Some studies \cite{dadkhah2020publications, duygu2023analysis} have
focused on this type of analysis.

Chapter \ref{section:state_of_the_art} discussed many works that addressed privacy challenges in the
IoT and some that proposed approaches to address these issues. The current chapter assesses
different aspects of the included papers including their general information,
purpose, intended application, issues that still exist, and any other comments
that should be taken into account.

The focus of the first research question \textbf{RQ1} is on identifying current
approaches for dealing with privacy issues in IoT.
The data shown in Figure \ref{fig:literature_domain} provides an overview
of the literature per IoT domain, however, it does not include works that are
specifically devoted to system literature reviews or the privacy paradox, for
instance, only works that propose an approach to IoT privacy issues.
Based on this data, it is shown that networking was the main topic of
25\% of the studies included \cite{SunSecure, AliIoT, electronics12122589, KumarLTE},
while IoT system design \cite{opara2022framework, perera2020designing} and
mobile IoT applications \cite{FengDesign, DasPersonalized} each accounted
for 12.5\% of the studies. Smart vehicles \cite{zhao2020local}, IoT
research \cite{koohang2022internet}, digital literacy \cite{SkirpanPrivacy},
IoT regulations \cite{hadzovic2023path}, smart homes \cite{xiong2018defending},
healthcare \cite{AntunesFederated}, AI \cite{zhang2017privacy} and
smart cities \cite{ZhuIntegrating} were the topics of 6.25\% of the studies
each.

% A summary of the literature with the pros and cons can be seen in Table \ref{table:literature}.

There are two main ways to provide privacy in IoT systems, through security
or providing in some way user awareness like the in the case of using privacy
notices, other ways like through legislation or with the
creation/usage of a framework or architecture that provides privacy mainly
fall into one these two categories, for instance, Weber \cite{WEBER2015618} argued
for better and more precise regulations and later came regulations like the GDPR and CCPA in
the EU and USA, respectively, and with this more privacy notices appeared and
more security rules were imposed by organisations. Literature that addresses
any AI field \cite{zhao2020local, AntunesFederated, zhang2017privacy} or
blockchain \cite{AliIoT} also fall under privacy through security.
Most of the literature assumes that security and privacy are
synonyms, for example \cite{opara2022framework, FabianoInternet, SunSecure},
and so most of the proposed solutions fall under privacy through security.
The proposed solutions that use privacy notices, like \cite{FengDesign},
are implemented in a way that use other devices like smartphones that provide
the notices themselves, it is hard to provide privacy notices on the IoT
devices themselves because many of these devices do not have a screen or
the screen is too small to provide the necessary information to the user.
Because there are still no standards for implementing privacy notices, and
best practices are scattered throughout the literature, they are mostly
implemented haphazardly, little guidance is given to designers and developers
on how to make a privacy notice design that is sufficient and acceptable
for their particular system and its features. Designers may be unaware of
the numerous possibilities for creating acceptable privacy notifications
and, as a result, do not systematically explore them.

Aleisa and Renaud \cite{aleisa2016privacy} also identify security and privacy
awareness as potential solutions to privacy issues in IoT, but also identify
data minimization, hitchhiking and introspection. Data minimization entails
limiting the collecting of personal information to what is absolutely central
and retaining the data just for as long as is required to satisfy the goal
of the technology's services \cite{ojDirective281}. Hitchhiking \cite{tang2006putting}
is a method of protecting the privacy of users who divulge their location,
applications regard locations as the object of their attention. The fidelity
trade-off is removed as it is not important to know who is in a certain
location. The introspection \cite{kang2015protection} method examines Virtual
Machine (VM) actions to adequately safeguard users' private information.
Every VM's CPU status, memory contents, network information provided by the
hypervisor, and any malicious software that may be present on the VM are
all collected and analysed. The privacy of individuals is jeopardized if
an IoT device loses integrity due to a hostile assault.

Despite the fact that IoT usage has increased over the previous decade and
the number of research publications has also increased, there is still a lack
of focus on privacy as opposed to security or artificial intelligence, for
example. IoT poses certain privacy concerns that are difficult to handle, and
as a result, achieving certain goals will necessitate further research and
financing.

The second research question \textbf{RQ2} is concerned with detecting frequent
challenges that make addressing IoT privacy difficult. IoT complexity of architectures,
applications and technologies make it hard to address these problems. The
cacophony of networks makes interoperability hard to achieve between IoT systems
without the use of intermediaries. The challenges identified by both Qu et
al. \cite{Qu2018Privacy} and Ranjan et al. \cite{perera2015big} are also hard
to address and have not yet been elegantly overcome.
The receptiveness of private organizations to embrace better privacy procedures
can also be a challenge, due to the capitalistic nature of the majority of the
world's companies. Many organizations in the IT area make most of their profits
from advertising, or otherwise from user's private data, as such they are incentivized
to keep harvesting data, and even with regulations in place and privacy frameworks
that safeguard personal data it might make financial sense for most organizations
to not invest in privacy or security, as paying fines for data breaches does not
disrupt their operations. Public organizations might behave differently.

\subsection{Study Analysis and an Application of Privacy Literacy}

To answer the research question \textbf{RQ3}, the questionnaire makes it clear that there is
a general lack of digital literacy, especially when it comes to IoT.
This still being a new technology and only quickly expanding
on the last decade, the people that have the most knowledge are the
ones working in areas related to IT or technology in general.
This survey also helps to demystify the privacy paradox.

Participants seemed eager to learn more about IoT, many had no
knowledge of the term, even if some of them knew some devices
that belong to the IoT. Some participants took the time to search
online about terms that appeared on the questionnaire to get some
idea of what they are about and spent some time discussing them.

The usability tests were very important in improving certain aspects of the
application. As was mentioned in the previous chapter, when the first
usability tests were being conducted, the application was only available
in english, but this soon changed, and a portuguese translation was added.
Other improvements added based on participant's feedback was a button
to add an IoT device in the page where is possible to see all available
devices. The icons were also altered, because participants complained that
they were not sure how to read them, even after using the application for some time.

As concluded in the survey, users do not have a great deal of literacy
regarding IoT, they do have some privacy literacy though, so
to answer the research question \textbf{RQ4}, this application servers to increase users
privacy literacy by giving them tools to know what kind of devices
are around them, what these devices do and give them more information
regarding IoT in general and IoT privacy, so that users may make
well-informed choices.

The application by itself does not provide any formal privacy protection
on IoT devices, but users can use it to better their understanding of IoT
and in some cases make privacy choices regarding an IoT device.

One problem this application faces, and other applications where there is
some kind of user interaction also face, is the fact that some bad
actors will abuse the system by creating many fake accounts, by
data scrapping, by adding bogus data or by replacing existing information
with fake data.

Some level of theoretical saturation \cite{low2019pragmatic} was reached with the use of the questionnaire
and the usability tests, i.e., it was extracted the most amount of information
possible from the participants on this topic of privacy on IoT systems, since
when doing the usability tests most participants also completed the questionnaire.

The author does not claim, with the development of this application, that
it is the greatest solution for tackling IoT privacy issues, but it improves
and builds upon previous works by not only focusing on privacy choices but also
fostering privacy literacy among end users, which is the ultimate goal
of the application. While existing works are fragmented on their approach,
this application offers a more centralized way by allowing users to complete
all tasks within the platform. Users can also contribute to the application itself
through various methods, the most straightforward way is by using it to
add new IoT devices to the database, they can also leave
feedback for improving the application on distribution platforms like
GitHub \footnote{Vieira, N. (2023). IoT Privacy (Version 0.33.0) [Computer software]. \url{https://github.com/nelson-vieira/masters-thesis/tree/master/masters-thesis/app}}.
Because this application is distributed as free and open source software, it
is possible for users to contribute to the development of the
application itself by creating pull requests, which is essentially coding,
or giving feedback about features, raising questions or reporting bugs,
additionally, the fact that anyone can inspect the source code helps
to demystify privacy concerns about the application itself.
