# User Stories

## Preamble

```
General template:  
As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]
```

To keep in mind: INVEST set of criteria by Bill Wake:
- **I**ndependent - user stories can be developed in any sequence and changes to one user story don't affect the others.
- **N**egotiable - it's up for the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.
- **V**aluable - each user story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.
- **E**stimable - it's quite easy to guess how much time the development of a user story will take.
- **S**mall - it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.
- **T**estable - there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a user story is implemented appropriately.
