\section*{Information}

This usability test is being carried out within the scope of the Master's thesis
in Informatics Engineering at the University of Madeira, created by Nelson Vieira,
it aims to gather information about the application's usability, design, and bugs
or other undesirable qualities in order to make it more robust and user friendly.
