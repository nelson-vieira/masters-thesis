# Measuring System Usability

## Introduction

First do survey as an introduction to the usability test of the application, if the participant hasn't already done the survey, otherwise ask the following questions:

For participants that have already done the survey ask (1) and (2), for others only (3).
1. Have you ever heard of Internet of Things?
2. (if '1' yes) In your words what is Internet of Things?
3. (if '1' yes) Do you think digital privacy relates in any way to Internet of Things?

Then, explain how this application came to be. It aims to raise digital literacy with focus on privacy in relation to Internet of Things devices, users can use the application to see which devices are around and what they do (ex. what information is being collected, for how long, who owns the devices). Users can register and add devices they know about to the application.

## Tasks (using Single Ease Question)

1. Go to devices page
2. Look up more information about one device
3. On the homepage look up more information about one device
4. Look up more information about this application
5. Create an account
6. Look up more information about privacy and Internet of Things on the app
7. Look up a tutorial on how to add a device
8. Add a device to the application
9. Update a device on the application

After **every** task:
| Question                  | Very difficult - Very easy |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Overall this task was?      | O O O O O O O       |

### Final Questions (using System Usability Scale)

| Question                  | Strongly disagree - Strongly agree |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.      | O O O O O O O       |
| 2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.   | O O O O O O O        |
| 3. I thought the system was easy to use.   | O O O O O O O       |
| 4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.   | O O O O O O O        |
| 5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.   | O O O O O O O        |
| 6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system   | O O O O O O O        |
| 7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.   | O O O O O O O        |
| 8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.   | O O O O O O O        |
| 9. I felt very confident using the system.   | O O O O O O O        |
| 10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.   | O O O O O O O        |

- After using the app, do you think it sparked your curiosity to learn more about privacy in Internet of Things systems?

- After using the app, do you think it sparked your curiosity to learn more about digital privacy in general?

- Can you easily identify which device collects what data just by seeing them in the map or on the devices page?

- What would you change on the app to make it easier to use?

- Do you have any other suggestion?
