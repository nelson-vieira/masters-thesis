abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices create new ways through which personal data is collected and processed by service providers. Frequently, end users have little awareness of, and even less control over, these devices' data collection. IoT Personalized Privacy Assistants (PPAs) can help overcome this issue by helping users discover and, when available, control the data collection practices of nearby IoT resources. We use semi-structured interviews with 17 participants to explore user perceptions of three increasingly more autonomous potential implementations of PPAs, identifying benefits and issues associated with each implementation. We find that participants weigh the desire for control against the fear of cognitive overload. We recommend solutions that address users' differing automation preferences and reduce notification overload. We discuss open issues related to opting out from public data collections, automated consent, the phenomenon of user resignation, and designing PPAs with at-risk communities in mind.},

abstract = {“Notice and choice” is the predominant approach for data privacy protection today. There is considerable user-centered research on providing effective privacy notices but not enough guidance on designing privacy choices. Recent data privacy regulations worldwide established new requirements for privacy choices, but system practitioners struggle to implement legally compliant privacy choices that also provide users meaningful privacy control. We construct a design space for privacy choices based on a user-centered analysis of how people exercise privacy choices in real-world systems. This work contributes a conceptual framework that considers privacy choice as a user-centered process as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to design meaningful privacy choices in their systems. We also present a use case of how we leverage the design space to finalize the design decisions for a real-world privacy choice platform, the Internet of Things (IoT) Assistant, to provide meaningful privacy control in the IoT.},

In this study, we implemented identical IoT configurations in eight households to evaluate the installation and privacy concerns in the early adoption of IoT devices in our participants’ homes. The specific contributions of this work are insights into privacy perceptions of and challenges to the adoption of networked smart home devices and privacy management of IoT devices. The focus in this work was on participants’ privacy concerns about devices deployed in an IoT ecosystem influencing their gradual change of use. We detail how we use a three-week longitudinal interview protocol to compare user perceptions of privacy risk. We assessed users’ comfort with devices, perceived benefits, and data sensitivity. We discuss the factors identified by participants as relevant to their personal security and privacy management of in-home devices. We close with recommendations for privacy preserving smart home devices grounded in our participants’ experiences.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is generating and processing a huge amount of data that is then used and shared to improve services and applications in various industries. The collected data are always including sensitive information (sensitive data, users/devices/applications behaviors, etc.), which can be exchanged over the IoT to third-party for storing, processing, and sharing with associated applications. It is important to protect data privacy from compromising using consistently privacy preserving techniques. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for both structured data and unstructured data by using data anonymization techniques, which is able to enhance privacy associated to IoT services, applications, users/device behavior. This can allow IoT users/devices to access privacy-enhanced data protecting sensitive data against re-identification risks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide privacy-enhanced data for third-party services and applications over the IoT.},

LTEye's analytics enable researchers and policy makers to uncover serious deficiencies in these networks due to inefficient spectrum utilization and inter-cell interference. In addition, LTEye extends synthetic aperture radar (SAR), widely used for radar and backscatter signals, to operate over cellular signals. This enables businesses and end-users to localize mobile users and capture the distribution of LTE performance across spatial locations in their facility. As a result, they can diagnose problems and better plan deployment of repeaters or femto cells. We implement LTEye on USRP software radios, and present empirical insights and analytics from multiple AT&amp;T and Verizon base stations in our locality.},
