    abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices create new ways through which personal data is collected and processed by service providers. Frequently, end users have little awareness of, and even less control over, these devices' data collection. IoT Personalized Privacy Assistants (PPAs) can help overcome this issue by helping users discover and, when available, control the data collection practices of nearby IoT resources. We use semi-structured interviews with 17 participants to explore user perceptions of three increasingly more autonomous potential implementations of PPAs, identifying benefits and issues associated with each implementation. We find that participants weigh the desire for control against the fear of cognitive overload. We recommend solutions that address users' differing automation preferences and reduce notification overload. We discuss open issues related to opting out from public data collections, automated consent, the phenomenon of user resignation, and designing PPAs with at-risk communities in mind.},

    abstract = {``Notice and choice'' is the predominant approach for data privacy protection today. There is considerable user-centered research on providing effective privacy notices but not enough guidance on designing privacy choices. Recent data privacy regulations worldwide established new requirements for privacy choices, but system practitioners struggle to implement legally compliant privacy choices that also provide users meaningful privacy control. We construct a design space for privacy choices based on a user-centered analysis of how people exercise privacy choices in real-world systems. This work contributes a conceptual framework that considers privacy choice as a user-centered process as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to design meaningful privacy choices in their systems. We also present a use case of how we leverage the design space to finalize the design decisions for a real-world privacy choice platform, the Internet of Things (IoT) Assistant, to provide meaningful privacy control in the IoT.},

In this study, we implemented identical IoT configurations in eight households to evaluate the installation and privacy concerns in the early adoption of IoT devices in our participants' homes. The specific contributions of this work are insights into privacy perceptions of and challenges to the adoption of networked smart home devices and privacy management of IoT devices. The focus in this work was on participants' privacy concerns about devices deployed in an IoT ecosystem influencing their gradual change of use. We detail how we use a three-week longitudinal interview protocol to compare user perceptions of privacy risk. We assessed users' comfort with devices, perceived benefits, and data sensitivity. We discuss the factors identified by participants as relevant to their personal security and privacy management of in-home devices. We close with recommendations for privacy preserving smart home devices grounded in our participants' experiences.},

The collected data are always including sensitive information (sensitive data, users/devices/applications behaviors, etc.), which can be exchanged over the IoT to third-party for storing, processing, and sharing with associated applications. It is important to protect data privacy from compromising using consistently privacy preserving techniques. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for both structured data and unstructured data by using data anonymization techniques, which is able to enhance privacy associated to IoT services, applications, users/device behavior. This can allow IoT users/devices to access privacy-enhanced data protecting sensitive data against re-identification risks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide privacy-enhanced data for third-party services and applications over the IoT.},

The results provide important implications for research and practice. Our study should contribute by initiating an integrative stream of research on the impact of IT and other factors on information privacy perception. For practitioners, our findings suggested that consumers hold corporations, not the IS, responsible for any inappropriate use of personal information. Organizations, therefore, must be proactive in formulating and enforcing information privacy policy in order to address consumers' concerns.}

With the development of IoT and wireless networks, plenty of smart devices are interconnected through wireless technologies such as 5G and Wi-Fi, making it possible to use them for information exchanging. The authors find a P2P network model for secure and anonymous communication, which is a typical Crowds system and the operating mechanism meets the characteristics of limited-resources of IoT devices. Based on this network model, the authors design a lightweight communication scheme for the remote-control system in this work, using two kinds of Virtual-Spaces to achieve the purpose of identity announced and data exchanged. The authors implemented a prototype system of the scheme and tested it over the Freenet, proving that the scheme can effectively resist the impact of flow analysis on the anonymity of communication while ensuring communication data security. By analyzing the scheme's performance, the author believes that the scheme is practical and is suitable for scenarios that are not time-sensitive but require high anonymity.},

This survey summarizes and analyzes differential privacy solutions to protect unstructured data content before it is shared with untrusted parties. These differential privacy methods obfuscate unstructured data after they are represented with vectors and then reconstruct them with obfuscated vectors. We summarize specific privacy models and mechanisms together with possible challenges in them. We also discuss their privacy guarantees against AI attacks and utility losses.

    abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) with electronic health records (EHR) is growing in popularity as a means to extract knowledge that can improve the decision-making process in healthcare. Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data. Studies also explore improvements to the aggregation mechanisms required to generate the learning model from distributed contributions and case studies with different types of medical data.},

    abstract = {Data sensing and gathering is an essential task for various information-driven services in smart cities. On the one hand, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can be deployed at certain fixed locations to capture data reliably but suffer from limited sensing coverage. On the other hand, data can also be gathered dynamically through crowdsensing contributed by voluntary users but suffer from its unreliability and the lack of incentives for users' contributions. In this article, we explore an integrated paradigm called ``hybrid sensing'' that harnesses both IoT-sensing and crowdsensing in a complementary manner. In hybrid sensing, users are incentivized to provide sensing data not covered by IoT sensors and provide crowdsourced feedback to assist in calibrating IoT-sensing. Their contributions will be rewarded with credits that can be redeemed to retrieve synthesized information from the hybrid system. In this article, we develop a hybrid sensing system that supports explicit user privacy—IoT sensors are obscured physically to prevent capturing private user data, and users interact with a crowdsensing server via a privacy-preserving protocol to preserve their anonymity. A key application of our system is smart parking, by which users can inquire and find the available parking spaces in outdoor parking lots. We implemented our hybrid sensing system for smart parking and conducted extensive empirical evaluations. Finally, our hybrid sensing system can be potentially applied to other information-driven services in smart cities.},

    abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are rising in popularity and their usefulness often stems from the amount of data they collect. Data regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require software developers to do their due diligence when it comes to privacy, as they are required to adhere to certain principles such as Privacy-by-Design (PbD). Due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of IoT applications, privacy-preserving design is even more important in IoT environments. Studies have shown that developers are often not eager to implement privacy and generally do not see it as their duty or concern. However, developers are often left alone when it comes to engineering privacy in the realm of IoT. In this paper, we therefore survey which frameworks and tools have been developed for them, especially in the case of IoT. Our findings indicate that existing solutions are cumbersome to use, only work in certain scenarios, and are not enough to solve the privacy issues inherent IoT development. Based on our analysis, we further propose future research directions.}

    abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) emerged as a paradigm in which smart things collaborate among them and with other physical and virtual objects using the Internet in order to perform high level tasks. These things appear in a variety of application domains, including smart grid, health care and smart spaces where several parties share data in order to tackle specific tasks. Data in such domains are rich in sensitive data and data owner-specific habits. Thus, IoT raises concerns about privacy and data protection. This paper reports on a systematic literature review of privacy preserving solutions used in Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) in the IoT field. To do so, and after retrieving scientific productions on the subject, we classify the results according to several facets. In this paper, we consider a subset of them: (i) data life cycle, (ii) privacy preserving techniques and (iii) ISO privacy principles. We combine the facets then express and analyze the results as bubble charts. We analyze the proposed solutions in terms of the techniques they deployed and the privacy principles they covered according to the ISO standard and the data privacy laws and regulations of the European Commission on the Protection of Personal Data. Finally, we identifies recommendations to involve privacy principle coverage and security requirement fulfillment in the IoT applications.",

Traditional security countermeasures cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to the different standards and communication stacks involved. Moreover, the high number of interconnected devices arises scalability issues; therefore a flexible infrastructure is needed able to deal with security threats in such a dynamic environment. In this survey we present the main research challenges and the existing solutions in the field of IoT security, identifying open issues, and suggesting some hints for future research.}

    abstract = {Video-analytics-as-a-service is becoming an important offering for cloud providers. A key concern in such services is privacy of the videos being analyzed. While trusted execution environments (TEEs) are promising options for preventing the direct leakage of private video content, they remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks. We present Visor, a system that provides confidentiality for the user's video stream as well as the ML models in the presence of a compromised cloud platform and untrusted co-tenants. Visor executes video pipelines in a hybrid TEE that spans both the CPU and GPU. It protects the pipeline against side-channel attacks induced by data-dependent access patterns of video modules, and also addresses leakage in the CPU-GPU communication channel. Visor is up to 1000x faster than naïve oblivious solutions, and its overheads relative to a non-oblivious baseline are limited to 2x-6x.},

    abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin, can prove to be essential towards realizing the vision of a decentralized, secure, and open Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. There is a growing interest in many research groups towards leveraging blockchains to provide IoT data privacy without the need for a centralized data access model. This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms. The architecture is aimed to have privacy built into it, and to be adaptable for various IoT use cases. To understand the feasibility and deployment considerations for implementing the proposed architecture, we conduct performance analysis of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum and Monax.},
