\begin{abstract}
Os dispositivos da \textit{Internet of Things} (IoT) estão em toda parte, desde o
nascimento da computação ubíqua que a vida quotidiana humana é imaginada
contendo milhões de dispositivos que controlam todos os aspectos de nossas
vidas. Hoje em dia temos carros inteligentes, casas inteligentes, cidades
inteligentes, \textit{wearables} entre outras coisas que usam vários tipos
de dispositivos e vários tipos de redes para comunicarem. Estes dispositivos
criam novas formas de recolher e processar dados pessoais de utilizadores
e não utilizadores. A maioria dos utilizadores finais nem sabem ou têm pouco
controlo sobre as informações que estão a ser recolhidas por estes sistemas.
Este trabalho faz uma abordagem holística deste problema, fazendo primeiro
uma revisão da literatura, depois realizando um questionário para saber mais
sobre o conhecimento geral do público e, finalmente, com base nas informações
recolhidas, é proposto um sistema que fornece aos utilizadores informações
sobre o dispositivos que estão próximos e como proteger os dados que não
desejam compartilhar com estes dispositivos, este sistema é capaz de detectar
que tipo de dispositivos estão próximos, que tipo de dados são recolhidos
por estes dispositivos, mostrar opções de privacidade ao utilizador quando
é possível fazê-lo e o que pode ser feito para evitar que dados indesejados
sejam recolhidos.

\section{Introdução}

A privacidade como a conhecemos é um conceito relativamente recente \cite{vincent2016privacy, moore2017privacy},
antes da era digital quase não havia a noção de privacidade para a maioria
das pessoas. Durante muitos séculos, a maioria das pessoas residia em pequenas
comunidades onde estavam continuamente envolvidas na vida umas das outras.
Ainda mais recente é a ideia de que a privacidade é um componente crucial da
segurança pessoal, em contraste com a inegável necessidade da segurança pública,
incluindo a exigência de muros vigiados e portas fechadas. Há muito vista
como um luxo, a privacidade ainda costuma ser vista como um bem de se ter
e não como um requisito essencial, embora seja reconhecida como um direito
humano, conforme consta no artigo 12 da Declaração Universal dos Direitos
Humanos \cite{RooseveltUniversal}: ``Ninguém sofrerá intromissões arbitrárias
na sua vida privada, na sua família, no seu domicílio ou na sua correspondência,
nem ataques à sua honra e reputação. Contra tais intromissões ou ataques
toda a pessoa tem direito a protecção da lei''. A privacidade pode ser definida
\cite{InternationalWhat, SpiekermannEngineering} como o direito de governar
como as informações e dados pessoais são recolhidos, armazenados e usados,
frequentemente envolve o uso de informações confidenciais com cuidado e, como
tal, as organizações devem ser abertas e honestas sobre o tipo de dados que
planeiam recolher, por que precisam deles e onde e com quem planeiam
partilhá-los. Os utilizadores devem ter o direito de controlar como as suas
informações são partilhadas.

% Privacy as we know it is a somewhat recent concept \cite{vincent2016privacy, moore2017privacy},
% before the digital age there was barely any notion of privacy for most
% people. For many centuries most people used to reside in small communities
% where they were continuously involved in one another's lives. Even more
% recent is the idea that privacy is a crucial component of personal security,
% in contrast to the undeniable necessity of public security, including the
% requirement for guarded walls and closed doors. Long seen as a luxury, privacy
% is still usually regarded as a good to have rather than an essential
% requirement, even though it is acknowledged as a human right, as present
% in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \cite{RooseveltUniversal}:
% ``No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,
% family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.
% Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference
% or attacks''. Privacy can be defined \cite{InternationalWhat, SpiekermannEngineering}
% as the right to govern how personal information and data is collected, stored,
% and used, it frequently involves handling sensitive information with care,
% and as such, organizations must be open and honest about the kind of data
% they plan to gather, why they need it, and where and with whom they plan
% to share it. Users should have the right to control their shared information.

Esta definição pode causar alguma confusão com a ideia de segurança \cite{HIVDifference}
e embora a privacidade e a segurança estejam interligadas, a segurança
envolve medidas tomadas para salvaguardar os dados de risco, ameaça ou perigo,
frequentemente alude à protecção. É a prática de manter a informação pessoal
dos utilizadores e dados seguros e prevenindo o acesso não autorizado aos
mesmos. O principal contraste entre privacidade e segurança é que o primeiro
trata de informações pessoais aos indivíduos e como querem que os seus dados
sejam utilizados e mantidos, enquanto este último trata da sua protecção contra
possíveis ameaças. A segurança pode existem sem privacidade, mas o oposto não
é verdade. Para a gestão de dados sensíveis e pessoais, privacidade e segurança
informática são igualmente cruciais. Os utilizadores devem estar cientes dos
procedimentos internos relativos à recolha, processamento, retenção, e partilha
de informação pessoal.

% This definition can cause some confusion with the idea of security \cite{HIVDifference}
% and although privacy and security are interconnected, security involves
% measures taken to safeguard data from risk, threat or danger, it frequently
% alludes to safety. It is the practice of keeping users' personal information
% and data safe and preventing unauthorized access to it. The primary contrast
% between privacy and security is that the former deals with personal information
% to individuals and how they want their data used and maintained, whilst
% the latter deals with its protection from possible threats. Security can
% exist without privacy, but the opposite is not true. For managing sensitive
% and personal data, privacy and computer security are equally crucial. Users
% should be aware of the internal procedures regarding the collection, processing,
% retention, and sharing of personal information.

As preocupações com a privacidade digital têm vindo a crescer \cite{emami2019exploring, park2022personal, zhang2022peer}
nos últimos anos, especialmente depois dos ataques informáticos do grupo
descentralizado de hackers \textit{Anonymous}, \textit{WikiLeaks} e da divulgação
de documentos ultra secretos da Agência de Segurança Nacional dos Estados
Unidos por Snowden. Estas preocupações podem ser notadas com o aumento da
literatura escrita sobre o assunto, ao procurar termos como ``privacy'',
``online privacy'', ``digital privacy'' no Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library
ou Science Direct, pode ser visto que, nos últimos 5 anos, retornam cerca
de 5000000, 650000 e 80000 documentos, respectivamente, incluindo artigos,
livros, artigos de conferência, etc.

% Concerns about digital privacy have been growing \cite{emami2019exploring, park2022personal, zhang2022peer}
% in the last few years, especially after the Anonymous decentralized hacker
% group cyber attacks, WikiLeaks and Snowden's leaked top secret documents
% from United State's National Security Agency. These concerns can be noted
% with the increase of written literature on the subject, when searching for
% terms like ``privacy'', ``online privacy'', ``digital privacy'' in Google
% Scholar, ACM Digital Library or Science Direct it can be seen that, in the
% last 5 years, it returns about 5000000, 650000 and 80000 documents respectively,
% including articles, books, conference papers etc.

A maioria da investigação tem-se concentrado na \textit{web}, enquanto a
privacidade nos sistemas IoT não tem sido tão explorada. Uma vez que os
dispositivos IoT estão a tornar-se mais predominantes, surgem novos métodos
de comunicação, recolha, e análise de dados. Porque já existe uma quantidade
substancial de investigação centrada em privacidade na \textit{web} em vez de
privacidade na IoT, é um terreno muito mais fértil para explorar a questão
da privacidade no contexto da IoT.

% Most research has focused on the web, while privacy in IoT systems has not
% been explored as much. Because IoT devices are becoming more prevalent,
% new methods of communicating, gathering, and analyzing data emerge.
% Because there is already a substantial quantity of research focusing on
% web privacy rather than IoT privacy, it is a lot more fertile ground to
% explore the issue of privacy in the context of the IoT.

\textit{Internet of Things} é um termo que surgiu pela primeira vez nos
anos 90, e pode estar ligado ao artigo de Mark Weiser sobre a computação
ubíqua \cite{weiser1991computer} e o crescimento de dispositivos de todos
os tamanhos que comunicam entre si para realizar várias tarefas, tornando
o sonho de Weiser uma realidade. A primeira utilização do termo
\textit{Internet of Things} foi em 1999 pelo pioneiro da tecnologia
britânica Kevin Ashton \cite{KevinThat}, director executivo do Auto-ID
Center no Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), para descrever um
sistema em que os itens podem ser ligados à Internet por sensores. Ele
inventou a frase enquanto fazia uma apresentação para a Procter \& Gamble
para realçar o valor de ligar etiquetas de Identificação por Radiofrequência
(RFID) utilizadas em cadeias de fornecimento corporativas à Internet, a
fim de contar e rastrear bens sem a necessidade de assistência humana.
Estes dispositivos são utilizados em várias aplicações, começando em
casa \cite{marikyan2019systematic} com termostatos, frigoríficos, microondas,
etc., passando para carros inteligentes \cite{arena2020overview}, o
sistema educacional \cite{al2020survey}, as nossas roupas e os nossos
relógios \cite{niknejad2020comprehensive} e mesmo para o espaço exterior
\cite{AkyildizInternet}. Os recursos da IdC podem incluir equipamento IoT
(como assistentes domésticos inteligentes e veículos autónomos), serviços
IoT (como serviços de análise de vídeo ligados a câmaras inteligentes e
sistemas de localização de posição interior), ou aplicações IoT (como
aplicações remotas de televisão inteligente) que localizam e utilizam
informação sobre nós. A Internet of Things é agora amplamente utilizada
para descrever situações em que uma gama de objectos, gadgets, sensores,
e itens comuns estão ligados à Internet e têm capacidades computacionais.

% \textit{Internet of Things} is a term that first appeared in the 1990s,
% and it may be linked to Mark Weiser's paper on ubiquitous computing \cite{weiser1991computer}
% and the growth of devices of all sizes that communicate with one another
% to do various tasks, making Weiser's dream a reality. The first use of the
% term \textit{Internet of Things} was in 1999 by British technology pioneer
% Kevin Ashton \cite{KevinThat}, executive director of the Auto-ID Center
% at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to describe a system in
% which items may be connected to the internet by sensors. He came up with
% the phrase while giving a presentation for Procter \& Gamble to highlight
% the value of linking Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags used in
% corporate supply chains to the internet in order to count and track goods
% without the need for human assistance. These devices are used in various
% applications, starting at home \cite{marikyan2019systematic} with thermostats,
% fridges, microwaves, etc, moving on to smart cars \cite{arena2020overview},
% the educational system \cite{al2020survey}, our clothes and our watches \cite{niknejad2020comprehensive}
% and even into outer space \cite{AkyildizInternet}. IoT resources may include
% IoT equipment (like smart home assistants and autonomous vehicles), IoT
% services (like video analytics services linked to smart cameras and indoor
% position tracking systems), or IoT apps (like smart TV remote apps) that
% track and use information about us. Internet of Things is now widely used
% to describe situations in which a range of objects, gadgets, sensors, and
% ordinary items are connected to the internet and have computational capabilities.

The idea of using computers and networks in order to monitor and manage
devices is nothing new, despite the term \textit{Internet of Things} being
relatively recent.
Wireless technology improvements in the 1990s permitted the widespread
adoption of corporate and industrial machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions
for equipment monitoring and operation. Many early M2M solutions, on the
other hand, relied on proprietary purpose-built networks or industry-specific
standards rather than internet standards. To connect devices other than
computers to the internet is not a new concept. A Coke machine at Carnegie
Mellon University's Computer Science Department \cite{EverhartInteresting}
was the first ubiquitous device to be linked to the internet. The system,
which was created in 1982, remotely observed the out of stock lights on
the pressing buttons of the vending machine and broadcast the state of each
row of the vending machine on the network so that it could be accessed using
the Name/Finger protocol through a terminal. In 1990, a toaster that could
be turned on and off over the internet that was created by John Romkey \cite{RomkeyToast},
was demonstrated at the Interop Internet Networking show.

The Internet of Things can be defined as: ``An open and comprehensive network
of intelligent objects that have the capacity to auto-organize, share information,
data and resources, reacting and acting in face of situations and changes
in the environment'' \cite{madakam2015internet}.

IoT is one of the fastest growing technologies \cite{MohammadState}, it
is predicted that it will grow into the trillions of devices by 2030 \cite{SarawiInternet},
and with this expansion new security vulnerabilities and data gathering
dangers appear, the lack of security in these devices makes them ideal targets
for privacy violations and inadequate customer disclosure of device capabilities
and data practices aggravates privacy and security issues.

Privacy in IoT systems in not seen as a crucial factor in development \cite{alhirabi2021security}.
Specific standards for privacy options have been imposed by data privacy
regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), but even these regulations have
been criticized \cite{peloquin2020disruptive, gladis2022weaponizing, gentile2022deficient, green2022flaws, byun2019privacy}.

\section{Estado da Arte}

\par
This section provides an overview of the recent literature with the themes
that were found to be more relevant for this work.

\subsection{Paradoxo da Privacidade}

The use of a variety of digital devices have numerous advantages, but they
also bring with them the ubiquity of data capturing equipment, therefore,
it is understandable why the majority of online users have serious concerns
about the privacy of their personal data. However, the opinions expressed
are starkly at odds with the reality, according to Thomson et al. \cite{DarrenState}
report on the state of privacy, that just one in four European users read
the terms and conditions in their entirety prior to making an online purchase
or subscribing to a service, 59\% admitted to only quickly scanning the
terms and conditions before completing a purchase, while 14\% admitted to
never reading them at all, 30\% of the respondents would even swap their
email address to win a reward, or entry into a raffle, while 17\% would do
so to get an app and 30\% would do it for money.

This is what is called a privacy paradox, there have been multiple papers
written on this subject \cite{solove2021myth, WilliamsPrivacy, lee2021investigating, goad2021privacy, gerber2018explaining},
some papers attempt a theoretical explanation while others attempt an empirical
one. There has been very different interpretations or explanations of this
paradox, a few papers \cite{wilson2012unpacking, warshaw2015can, lee2015privacy}
apply the theoretical concept of the \textit{homo economicus} \cite{zak2008moral},
which is the representation of people as beings who constantly act in a
way that is logical and self-interested, not worrying about morality or
ethics, and who do so to the best of their ability, to the context of privacy.
Different cognitive biases and heuristics can influence how consumers make
decisions, according to several studies on consumer choice behavior \cite{acquisti2007can, knijnenburg2013dimensionality, wakefield2013influence, flender2012type}.
According to several articles \cite{dienlin2015privacy, baek2014solving},
this paradox might be explained by the fact that some people have genuinely
experienced online privacy assaults and that most privacy views are therefore
based on heuristics or secondhand accounts. Taddicken's study \cite{taddicken2014privacy}
argues that peer pressure is the reason people have this contradictory behavior,
Norberg et al. \cite{norberg2007privacy} explains this paradox by suggesting
that while perceived risk affects reported attitudes and behavioral intentions,
trust has a direct impact on privacy behavior, while others \cite{flender2012type, kokolakis2017privacy}
rely on quantum theory. Brandimarte et al. \cite{brandimarte2013misplaced}
have explored the idea that when it comes to their data privacy, users have
an \textit{illusion of control}.

This paradox has been proven to be vitiated by a number of empirical studies \cite{dienlin2015privacy, xie2019consumers, SCHWAIG20131, sannon2018privacy},
online privacy practices are founded on separate privacy mindsets and so
they are not inherently paradoxical.

\subsection{Privacidade em IoT: Abordagens}

There have been a number of systematic literature reviews (SLR) \cite{Gupta2022Privacy, Kuhtreiber2022survey, sicari2015security, LinSurvey}
and systematic mapping reviews \cite{porras2018security, ahmed2019aspects}
done to study privacy and security issues in IoT.

In Gupta and Ghanavati's \cite{Gupta2022Privacy} SLR, the authors review
papers with methodologies and techniques that identify privacy risks or
notify users about these risks. They divide the literature into the following
categories: `Ontological Modeling and Semantic-based Approaches', `Data-Driven
Approaches', `Source Code Analysis-based Approaches', `User Studies and
Survey-based Approaches', `Blockchain-based Approaches' and `Architectural
and Framework-based Approaches'. They then examine current literature on
these three prerequisites. The findings show that: most works concentrate
on single IoT devices when addressing privacy threats; When analyzing privacy
issues, key privacy factors such as data reduction and data aggregation
are overlooked; existing studies ignored the sensitivity of the obtained
information; most useful studies did not include a diverse range of users
when assessing privacy problems; no work has been done to discover compliance
difficulties between an IoT application and different privacy rules; and
current research does not place a premium on providing consumers with real-time
privacy notices. However, this SLR has the following limitations: the authors
only chose articles and not thesis or books and from the selected papers,
only the ones written in english were considered.

Kühtreiber et al. \cite{Kuhtreiber2022survey} evaluate the frameworks and
tools established for developers, specifically in the case of IoT, and find
that current solutions are difficult to use, only successful in limited
scenarios, and insufficient to handle the privacy problems inherent in IoT
development. This study lacks a comprehensive gap review of the chosen
literature, along with research questions establishing the significance
of the articles chosen.

Sicari et al. \cite{sicari2015security} examine current research and ongoing
activities that focus on IoT privacy and security solutions. The authors
start by describing the requirements for IoT privacy and security, such
as access control, confidentiality, and authentication. The authors then
conduct a literature study in connection to these three needs. The authors
came to the conclusion that IoT privacy issues have only been partially
examined and that further attention is required. The study, however, has
flaws: the prior research analysis focuses primarily on security needs while
ignoring privacy considerations; the authors do not conduct a thorough gap
analysis on the publications examined; and they do not provide a comprehensive
summary of future research topics in the field of IoT privacy that require
more attention.

Lin et al. \cite{LinSurvey} undertake a literature review to identify security
and privacy vulnerabilities in the three IoT architecture layers: network,
perception, and application. The authors describe the first six fundamental
security properties for these tiers as confidentiality, integrity, availability,
identification and authentication, privacy, and trust. Then, the authors
look at a variety of security threats for each of the three stages. The
authors wrap up by giving a succinct summary of many privacy-preserving
data techniques, including the stages of data collection, data aggregation,
and data analysis. The authors do, however, largely focus on the IoT's security
components and, as was already said, consider privacy to be one of the most
crucial security aspects, rather than viewing privacy as a distinct concern.
Furthermore, the research does not conduct a thorough gap analysis to discover
the weaknesses of prior efforts.

Based on Ziegeldorf's \cite{ziegeldorf2014privacy} analysis of the literature,
the following are the most prominent privacy concerns in IoT:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The most prominent concern is \textit{identification}, which binds an
    identifier, such as a name and location, with an individual's identity,
    this also enables and aggravates other threats;
    \item
    \textit{Localization and tracking} is the threat of detecting an individual's
    locations through numerous techniques, such as GPS, internet traffic,
    or smartphone location. This threat requires \textit{identification}
    of some kind;
    \item
    In e-commerce, \textit{profiling} is often used for personalization.
    Organizations collect information about individuals in order to deduce
    their interests via association with other profiles and data sources.
    \item
    \textit{Interaction and presentation} allude to the sharing of private
    information with an unintended audience while doing so through a public
    medium. IoT applications often need extensive user interaction, it is
    expected that users of these systems will obtain information via smart
    devices in their immediate surroundings and that users will interface
    with systems in creative, natural ways. However, many of those modes
    of communication and presentation are already available to the broader
    public, making them apparent to anybody around. When personal information
    is transferred between a system and its user, privacy is breached.
    \item
    \textit{Lifecycle transitions} occur when an IoT device is sold, utilized
    by its owner and eventually disposed of. There may be an expectation
    that the object deletes all information, yet smart devices frequently
    keep massive volumes of data about their own past throughout their entire
    existence. This might contain personal images and videos, which are
    not always erased following ownership transfer.
    \item
    \textit{Inventory attacks} involve unauthorized entry and the acquisition
    of information about the presence and characteristics of personal things.
    Malicious users might use inventory data to profile the property and
    break in.
    \item
    \textit{Linkage} is the process of connecting disparate systems, when
    systems are connecting different data sources, there is a higher danger
    of unauthorized access and data leakage.
\end{enumerate}

Another concept worth analyzing is differential privacy which relates more
closely to the survey that will be conducted but also to the general
collection and analysis of user data by applications and systems.

\subsection{Privacidade Diferencial}

The notion of differential privacy, according to Michael Kearns \cite{kearns2019ethical},
is based on three important principles. The first being that ``differential
privacy requires that adding or removing the data record of a single individual
not change the probability of any outcome by much''. The second principle
being that ``no outside observer can learn very much about any individual
because of that person's specific data''. The third important principle
being that ``for every individual in the dataset, and for any observer no
matter what their initial beliefs about the world were, after observing
the output of a differentially private computation, their posterior belief
about anything is close to what it would have been had they observed the
output of the same computation run without the individual's data''.

Differential privacy has the potential to significantly increase individual
privacy protection, by purposefully adding noise into a dataset, it gives
plausible deniability to any individual who may have had their data exploited
while still being able to calculate statistics with relatively high precision.
Although algorithms that deal with notions of fairness, ethics, and privacy
are hard to implement because of the subjectivity of these concepts, and
differential privacy algorithms are no different, they can still help in
regards to addressing technology's inherent moral quandaries.

There exist other algorithms that aim to preserve privacy in the same way
as differential privacy such as Google's box blurring algorithm \cite{FromeLarge}
that is used in the Google Map's street view, Microsoft's Visor \cite{poddar2020visor}
which is a video-analytics-as-a-service tool and Shokri and Shmatikov's
\cite{ShokriPrivacy} system for collaborative deep learning, however, in
general, these algorithms struggle with high computational cost, internal
attacks, or non-provable privacy.

Zhao et al. \cite{ZhaoSurvey} conduct a SLR on differential privacy for
unstructured data. The authors present differential privacy methods for
sensitive content in image, audio, video, and text data. They compare the
various methods and perform utility analyses for each method, highlighting
the benefits and drawbacks of each, the utility loss is measured in experimental
evaluations between the actual data and its obfuscated variant. They come
to the conclusion that differential privacy as well as its variations give
stringent privacy protections for unstructured data against attackers with
unpredictable background knowledge. They also suggest potential future study
subjects that have yet to be investigated.

\subsection{Soluções Propostas}

\par This section list seven solutions that emerged from the structured
literature review to improve the gap between privacy and security concepts
among systems and users.

\subsubsection{Criando Novas Formas de Conscienlização para o Utilizador}

There has been some work done to determine the users awareness of their
actions online regarding their privacy. Skirpan et al. \cite{SkirpanPrivacy}
built an interactive theatre experience, this was created to try to prove
that a simulated experience with a credible privacy problem may encourage
people to take action before actually encountering a catastrophe. The plot
of the play consist in a fledgling tech company that unveiled its revolutionary
AI technology while dealing with a company whistleblower and an untimely
zero-day hack on their system. The public is able to interact with the actors
and influence how the story plays out. Audiences and actors were given the
chance to try on roles, behaviors, and opinions that they would not normally
have access to in ordinary life. The authors had interviews and surveys
done after the plays with audience members however they only did interviews
halfway through production and only a small fraction of the audience actually
participated in this data collection, they also noted that after contacting
people months after the interviews that they did not really changed their
behaviour regarding their privacy rights.

\subsubsection{Legislação}

Some papers seek to improve legislation \cite{WEBER2015618, FabianoInternet}
because otherwise, in their view, privacy rights won't be respected if they
are not enforceable legally, they defend that without the express agreement
of the individual concerned, private information obtained by IoT devices
must not be retained or processed in any form, and necessary procedures
must be taken to guarantee that the data collected is not that of an unrelated
individual. But better protection laws for the user would also create opposition
from most companies that want to extract as much private data from their
users without (m)any restrictions in order to increase their profit margins.

\subsubsection{Privacidade Através da Segurança}

Sun et al. \cite{SunSecure} design a lightweight communication strategy
for a remote-control system, employing two types of Virtual-Spaces to achieve
the aim of identity announcement and data exchange. They constructed a prototype
system of the scheme and tested it on the Freenet, demonstrating that the
method can effectively resist the influence of flow analysis on communication
anonymity while preserving communication data security.

\subsubsection{Propostas de Arquitetura / Frameworks}

Antunes et al. \cite{AntunesFederated} do a SLR on federated learning in
the area of healthcare and make an architecture proposal. The technique
known as federated learning allows for the distributed training of machine
learning models using remotely hosted datasets without the requirement for
data amplification. The fundamental goal of the proposed architecture is
to allow healthcare institutions that have access to sensitive medical information
to use it in distributed data analysis and machine learning research while
ensuring patient confidentiality. Because information transmitted among
institutions need confidentiality guarantees for learning model parameters
and analysis results, the architecture can adopt a number of ways based on
a zero-trust security paradigm \cite{ChenSecurity}. Furthermore, the institutions
develop a learning algorithm verification system that can store and disseminate
manifestos, as well as engage in distributed analytic procedures that need
unanimous agreement from all participants. This study also demonstrates
that previous literature implies that homomorphic encryption and differential
privacy are effective approaches for preventing data breaches without incurring
prohibitively high computing costs.

Opara et al. \cite{opara2022framework} present a system for spotting possible
problems with privacy or security regulations in the early stages of development,
this approach is intended at developers. The paper proposes a domain-specific
ontology for modeling IoT security and privacy policies, a notation for
representing and validating IoT security and privacy policies, a set of
guidelines and rules for detecting IoT policy errors, and a tool for visually
modeling and capturing IoT security policies and discovering policy problems.
Although the framework that is presented is theoretically promising it has
not been tested in a real environment so the effectiveness can't yet be
measured. The authors also do not compare their proposal with others already
available.

\subsubsection{Blockchain}

Blockchain is an option to guarantee privacy in IoT because of zero-knowledge
proofs, ring signatures and mixing \cite{PrivacyblockchainWikipedia}.

Yu et al. \cite{yu2018blockchain} shows various implementations of blockchain
that provide privacy through security, based on different categories like
data integrity, data sharing and authentication and access control. The
authors use privacy as a proxy for security, they also do not discuss the
weak and strong points of each implementation or make any comparison, they
also do not provide further research questions.

Ali et al. \cite{AliIoT} suggest a software stack that combines peer-to-peer
file sharing with blockchain smart contracts to offer IoT users control
over their data and do away with the necessity for centralized IoT data
management. Blockchain smart contracts are used in the proposed `modular
consortium' architecture to regulate access while establishing responsibility
for both data owners and other parties that users grant access to.

Zhu et al. \cite{ZhuIntegrating} present a hybrid sensor system that safeguards
privacy while also monitoring parking availability. The authors merged IoT
sensing with crowdsensing and enhanced it with privacy-preserving methods.
The authors employed physical hazy filters to mask IoT sensors in IoT sensing,
and a cryptographic technique based on cryptographic commitments, zero-knowledge
proofs, and anonymous credentials in crowdsensing. In addition, they used
crowdsourcing to create a machine learning model for parking recognition
in the presence of foggy filters. Their paper included proof-of-concept
prototypes such as a Raspberry Pi system and a mobile app, as well as an
evaluation study of the machine learning model and the effects of crowdsourcing.

\subsubsection{Assistentes de Privacidade}

There exists a number of privacy assistants in the market. Privacy assistants
have the objective of giving the user flexibility in choosing the preferred
privacy options in available applications, most are used in smartphones,
very few are made for devices in the IoT.

The Carnegie Mellon University CyLab, which is the university's security
and privacy research institute, started developing in 2019 an IoT Infrastructure
that intended to be free of privacy leaks and software covered by their
Secure and Private IoT Initiative 2019, this project would fall under
their main research theme of Trust. In this project they started the design
of a Personalized Privacy Assistant (PPA) \cite{ColnagoInforming}, this
would involve the use of semi-structured interviews with 17 participants
to examine user perceptions of three hypothetical PPA implementations,
each of which is potentially more autonomous, while outlining the advantages
and disadvantages of each implementation. The interviews were divided into
three sections: exploratory, anchoring and the PPA; While the exploratory
phase's purpose was to learn about participants' attitudes and understanding
of IoT, the anchoring phase aimed to normalize participants' basic understanding
of how IoT functions. In order to get people to think about potential privacy
concerns towards the end of the anchoring section, the authors asked participants
about their opinions on data privacy. In the PPA section, it was proposed
the idea of a PPA for IoT as a potential future project. The authors clarified
that the PPA could distinguish between active data requests such as a gadget
asking biometric information from the user's health tracker and passive
data collection such as a smart device with a microphone that could record
people's utterances while they were nearby. The Notification, Recommendation,
and Auto implementations of an IoT PPA were the three that the authors and
attendees discussed. Notification PPAs can determine which adjacent devices
are requesting data and alert users to those devices' presence and requests
so that users can approve or reject each request. Building on notification
PPAs, recommendation PPAs offer consumers advice on how to share their data
based on their preferences. The user's data sharing decisions would be made
by auto PPAs. This would lessen the cognitive load on consumers but also
take away their ability to influence the process. They found that the participants'
attitudes regarding the various implementations were generally favorable,
although they also voiced worries, which varied depending on the degree
of automation. Given the divergent motivations of participants some desired
increased control, while others wished to avoid being overtaken by notifications
and the lack of agreement regarding the optimal PPA implementation.

After the design phase, the institute implemented a privacy assistant (PA) \cite{FengDesign},
the authors called it IoT Assistant. Because the predominant approach of
"notice and choice" for data privacy protection, they decided the PA would
also fall into this approach, but because many systems implement notice
as a form of consent, without sometimes offering choices to the end user,
they also wanted this work to provide a conceptual framework that views
user-centered privacy choice as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to
use when designing meaningful privacy choices for their systems. The authors
define meaningful privacy choices as ``the capabilities provided by digital
systems for users to control different data practices over their personal
data'', They extend the notion of privacy choices with five facets: effectiveness
(the opportunity to establish privacy preferences that precisely and completely
match the data collection and use methods that a user is okay with), efficiency
(the capacity to specify these options with the least amount of effort and
time), user awareness (where significant privacy options should be prominently
and clearly communicated to users), comprehensiveness (users should understand
their options, how they affect the gathering and potential use of their
data, as well as what conclusions might be drawn from this data and the
potential repercussions of these conclusions) and neutrality (meaningful
privacy decisions should not be subject to manipulation or bias). The IoT
Assistant offers four privacy settings, giving end users a variety of alternatives
to better suit their varied privacy preferences and as a result, privacy
options are more effective in the IoT environment. The IoT Assistant acts
as a centralized privacy choice platform by implementing various privacy
options, allowing consumers to more effectively govern their data privacy
in IoT. The three IoT system discovery modes that the IoT Assistant supports
are QR codes, push notifications, and location-based map interfaces. These
discovery tools are probably going to make users more aware of the installed
IoT devices and the privacy options they have. Additionally, the united
viewpoint of the integrated notification and option in the the IoT Assistant
gives succinct yet thorough information regarding IoT data practices to
help users better understand the implications of their privacy choices.
Additionally, the authors work to implement the integrated notice and option
in the IoT Assistant without bias or framing, attempting to offer consumers
a neutral space to execute their privacy choices. Although the authors view
the IoT Assistant as a significant step towards ``meaningful privacy options''
in IoT, this assistant still has many problems, such as the fact that it
is still in its early stages of development and that there hasn't been much
growth given that it was created in 2020 and we are in 2023. Maybe the main
reason this application was not able to be developed further is that the
application itself serves to show the user the data that is already in the
IoT infrastructure that was created before, and as such it is not capable
of identifying new IoT devices without the end users themselves create on
the infrastructure's main webpage \cite{DasPersonalized} a new entry for
the device in question that the user wants to interact with. Another reason
that cripples this application as well as others that seek to provide better
privacy in IoT systems is that many systems do not offer any type of privacy
choices to the end user or to other users that are not the intended end
users but the devices are still collecting data about.

The IoT infrastructure that was developed \cite{DasPersonalized} is built
on an open, distributed design that allows for the deployment and management
of IoT resources to be carried out by any number of actors. Part of this
infrastructure is the Internet of Things Resource Registry, it is a web
platform that enables resource owners to declare not only the place where
a resource is deployed but also data practices like the reason(s) for a
particular data collecting process, the level of detail in the data being
gathered, retention, the recipients of the data, and more. Additionally,
it discloses any user-configurable privacy settings that might be connected
to a particular resource.

\subsection{Principais Levantamentos}

There are two main ways to provide privacy in IoT systems, through security
or using privacy notices, other ways like through legislation or with the
creation/usage of a framework that provides privacy fall into these two
categories. Most of the literature assumes that security and privacy are
synonyms, for example \cite{opara2022framework, FabianoInternet, SunSecure},
and so most of the proposed solutions fall under privacy through security.
The proposed solutions that use privacy notices, like \cite{FengDesign},
are implemented in a way that use other devices like smartphones that provide
the notices themselves, it is hard to provide privacy notices on the IoT
devices themselves because many of these devices do not have a screen or
the screen is too small to provide the necessary information to the user.
Because there are still no standards for implementing privacy notices, and
best practices are scattered throughout the literature, they are mostly
implemented haphazardly, little guidance is given to designers and developers
on how to make a privacy notice design that is sufficient and acceptable
for their particular system and its features. Designers may be unaware of
the numerous possibilities for creating acceptable privacy notifications
and, as a result, do not systematically explore them.

Aleisa and Renaud \cite{aleisa2016privacy} also identify security and privacy
awareness as potential solutions to privacy issues in IoT, but also identify
data minimization, hitchhiking and introspection. Data minimization entails
limiting the collecting of personal information to what is absolutely central
and retaining the data just for as long as is required to satisfy the goal
of the technology's services \cite{ojDirective281}. Hitchhiking \cite{tang2006putting}
is a method of protecting the privacy of users who divulge their location,
applications regard locations as the object of their attention. The fidelity
tradeoff is removed as it is not important to know who is in a certain
location. The introspection \cite{kang2015protection} method examines VM
actions to adequately safeguard users' private information. Every VM's
CPU status, memory contents, network information provided by the hypervisor,
and any malicious software that may be present on the VM are all collected
and analyzed. The privacy of consumers is jeopardized if an IoT device
loses integrity due to a hostile assault.

\section{Desafios de Privacidade}

IoT is a composed of a complex web of architectures, applications and technologies.
In terms of architectures, it can be decomposed in three layers: the perception
layer, the network layer and the application layer.

The perception layer, also known as the sensor layer, interacts with physical
objects and components via smart devices (RFID, sensors, actuators, and
so on). Its key objectives are to connect objects to the IoT network and
to monitor, collect, and analyze status information about these things using
deployed smart devices. This layer can often be unreliable, for instance
with autonomous vehicles where they find it hard to read road signs or to
predict if certain objects are inanimate or not, but this unreliability
also brings privacy even though some of the data might be unusable. Noise
can also be added in this layer to provide extra privacy.

In the network layer there are many competing networks like ZigBee, Z-Wave,
Bluetooth Low Energy, LoRa, Wi-fi, etc., this layer is fragmented specially
in regards to wireless networks and that makes it very difficult to create
an IoT architecture that can use various networks and have the various
devices communicate with each other, even though interoperability is seen
as a very important factor in IoT. Some of these networks are open standard
protocols while others are proprietary and use different protocols of communication,
use different frequencies, different ranges and different data rates. When
creating an IoT architecture the designers often think of how to solve
specific problems and use what is best for the current needs, and the way
that IoT is fragmented doesn't help in providing progress.

The application layer receives data from the network layer and uses it to
execute essential services or operations. This layer, for example, can provide
the storage service to backup incoming data into a database or the analysis
service to analyze received data in order to predict the future state of
physical devices. This layer encompasses a wide range of applications, each
with its own set of requirements. A few examples are smart grids, smart
transportation, and smart cities.

According to Qu et al. \cite{Qu2018Privacy}, several significant barriers
remain, including the lack of a theoretical foundation, the trade-off optimization
between privacy and data value, and system isomerism over-complexity. Because
there are no mathematical foundations for IoT structure design, IoT system
designs are planned and executed using empirical approaches, which have
limitations in IoT development. Scientific theory and quantitative analysis
must enable trade-off optimization, yet, there are multiple parties with
diverse characteristics and requirements, making this optimization highly
challenging. A plethora of standards and protocols add to the unneeded complexity
of system isomerism. Ensuring effective IoT applications while wasting as
little resources as feasible implies less resources available for privacy
protection, however, lightweight privacy protection cannot fulfill all of
the criteria, and attackers can exploit structural information to launch
several concurrent attacks.

\section{Metadologia}

The overall work will be comprised of two phases which will be described
in the following paragraphs. Phase one mainly described throughout this
paper, focuses on collecting the state of the art in terms of the most relevant
topics, from which main privacy concepts were selected to be explored in
the stage 1 of Phase 2 with the preparation of a questionnaire to collect
user perceptions regarding privacy and topics collected in the systematic
literature review. The second stage of Phase 2 consists in developing an
application, partially based on the information generated by the survey,
that can identify what sort of devices are around, what kind of data is
gathered by these devices, present privacy options to the user when available,
and what can be done to prevent undesirable data from being collected.
\par
The Phase 1 Systematic Literature Review gathered the most relevant papers
discussing methodologies and techniques for the protection of users' privacy
data with special focus on IoT systems. For this SLR, this paper considered
focusing only on papers from the last 12 years, from 2010 until 2022, since
papers before then become out of date with the evolution of technology.
In this SLR, it was reviewed 54 papers published in top computer science,
security, privacy and software engineering outlets.

This paper followed Keshav's three-pass approach \cite{KeshavHow} when choosing
which papers to read fully and which ones to ignore, first the title would
be read, then the abstract, the introduction and conclusion and briefly
skim the rest of the paper and then decide if it was worth reading any further,
the focal point in this phase was answering the following question: does
the paper present a new methodology or interesting angle to tackle users'
privacy concerns? Only then the document would be read in its entirety while
ignoring any tables, figures, images or graphs. If the paper failed to present
any interesting idea, approach, or technique it would be discarded, but
if not, it would be read carefully from the beginning again in order to
fully understand what it presents. Having collected the major findings,
this work then aims to conduct a throughout study split in several stages
and around the specific research questions which will be explored in each
phase. For that matter, the research questions listed are:

\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{Phase 1:} \\

\textbf{RQ1:} What approaches are being considered for privacy issues in
IoT in the currently available literature?

\textbf{RQ2:} What are user perceptions on online privacy? \\

\textbf{Phase 2:} \\

\textbf{RQ3:}
How to empower users to protect their privacy rights?

\textbf{RQ4:} What issues are prevalent in IoT that make it difficult to
address privacy and security problems?
\vspace{5mm}

The second phase will be evaluated on two stages, the first one consists
on doing a study on people's general privacy concerns, while using and interacting
with IoT devices. This study will abide on preparing a questionnaire to
assess general user's knowledge on privacy concepts, their habits and concerns,
their understanding of privacy rights, and what they do to safeguard those
rights. The goal of this study is to both understand the privacy paradox
and collect data on their proposal to address privacy issues with regard
to IoT devices.

\subsection{Estágio 1: Percepções do Utilizador}

This study aims to understand people's perception of IoT and their privacy
practices online. It also serves to demystify the privacy paradox and also
to help provide a solution to the privacy issue in IoT. The questionnaire
consists of 92 questions divided into 7 sections to access users' knowledge,
it follows a kind of narrative, the first section being general privacy
questions then about the predisposition to data sharing, to concerns with
privacy then about daily digital routines, then about profile identification,
and then about IoT general knowledge before a section about non-identifiable
demographic data. The scale that is used in the questionnaire is based on
the work of Philip K. Masur \cite{masur2018situational}. Great care is taken
when it comes to this survey's data collection, in order to not identify
any individual or group of individuals, for instance, when it comes to differential
privacy, any data that might identify someone will not be disclosed, even
though the data might suffer from some inaccuracy because of this.

This survey was partially based in a study done in the Philippines by the
government in the context of their privacy act of 2012 \cite{Philippine2022Conduct},
this was the second survey done on the country's population. It was also
inspired by Alves's master's thesis \cite{alves2021}, which was about citizen's
perception about privacy in the wake of GDPR.

This survey was done through the internet, it was created in Google Forms,
this way it is guaranteed to reach the most people possible, besides Google
Forms itself, it will be used other online venues for distribution and even
printing.

\subsection{Estágio 2: Estudo no Contexto, uma Aplicação}

This work proposes an application that gives users information about IoT
devices in their surroundings like the type of information these devices
collect and what privacy options are available. This application will be
developed for mobile phones because it is the most used device that people
take everywhere they go, and because the application will use georeferencing
to show the location of the IoT devices. The main objective of this application
is to give users another option in order to protect their private data.
The application will show the geolocation of the IoT devices, what type
of device it is, what type of data is being collect by the device. The application
will not detect the devices by itself, this will be done by the users themselves,
in the first few iterations of this application it was proposed that the
application itself would detect the devices and would categorize what type
of device it was and what type of data it was collecting but it was discovered
that this approach was too complex and so it was not feasible to do with
the constraints of this paper. The application will be developed with Flutter,
other options could be React Native or a progressive web application, but
Flutter uses ahead of time and just in time compilation with Dart as it
is programming language while React Native uses the Javascript programming
language that was never created for mobile programming so it uses a bridge
to convert Javascript to native components for Android or iOS. Flutter has
better performance and as such it is the chosen framework for this application.

\section{Estado Atual do Projeto}

The preliminary results of the study, based on 10 responses, show that everyone
agrees that privacy is important to them and some people know that they
should not share their personal information with anyone they do not trust
(like clicking on random urls or using unprotected websites/software), but
most of them think that privacy and security are the same concept, most
respondents also do not read privacy notices but accept them to access the
information they want to get to, most respondents use their devices mostly
to access social networks and for work, when it comes to IoT, there is a
dissonance between knowing the term and using devices like smart watches
or RFID enabled devices, from the respondents that answered yes to using
IoT devices most use because of work. It is also noted that most respondent
have a background in engineering, so the responses are skewed. As a result,
the survey will remain open to gather a larger number of responses and participants
for more significant results and generalizations.

design of the application and the enquiry of the study followed by the development
of the application and the synthesis of the study, and finally testing and
refinement of the application. Because of the exploratory nature of this
work the application might suffer alterations to the design, specially in
the testing stage, and also depending on the results of the study.

\section{Trabalho Futuro}

Although there are existing hardware solutions that can detect some devices
on particular networks, like ZigBee or Bluetooth LE, namely IoT sniffers
and there exist some georeferencing applications that try to pinpoint certain
IoT devices, there is still a need for some kind of device or framework
that is network agnostic and can detect where the devices are located and
what kind of data the IoT devices that are around it are collecting. This
gadget should also be capable of informing users about the privacy notices
of the devices and what can the users do to safeguard their personal data.
The IoT sniffers that are available are primarily used in the detection
of problems in the communication of devices in the network or to solve problems
of interoperability between different IoT networks. There are many obstacles
that impede the creation of such a device and the fact that it still does
not exist anything like it may be related ton either there iss not enough
interest from users or researchers to focus on such an endeavour or the
complexity of such a task is greater than the rewards.

\section{Conclusão}

This project aims to do an exploratory analysis of privacy in IoT systems.
It proposes a survey to better understand user's knowledge on this subject
and an application that aims to create more users awareness and better inform
about their environment, as well as the IoT devices that inhabit it and
how they can respond accordingly.

Hopefully the work conducted on this project will be useful to further support
researchers and the application that will be developed will be able to
provide greater visibility, thus allowing users to acquire knowledge about
the data being collected and how they can adjust their behavior or respond
more effectively to protect their privacy rights.
